## 🔨 **Objectives and Learning Goals**

These laboratory activities and exercise sets will help you:
- Understand key Java concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, and arrays.
- Implement OOP principles such as: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Work with Java collections and perform operations on groups of objects.
- Build practical applications using these concepts, from simple programs to more advanced object-oriented designs.

---

## 📌 **Additional Information**
- All Java files are designed to demonstrate various OOP concepts and enhance your coding skills.
- Output screenshots and examples are included for visual references of each program's execution.

---

## ✨ **Java OOP Concepts**
Learn, implement, and build powerful Java applications with Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as:
- **Inheritance:** Creating classes that inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Using objects of different classes interchangeably through inheritance.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulating data to hide implementation details and only expose necessary functionalities.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding the complex implementation details and only showing the essential features.

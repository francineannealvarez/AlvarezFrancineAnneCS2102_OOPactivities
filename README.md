# ☕️ Java Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory Activities and Exercise Sets

Welcome to the **CS 211: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** Activities repository! This repository contains all the laboratory activities and exercise sets from the course. It showcases a collection of Java projects focusing on key OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## 🔍 Lab Activities

### 📝 **Laboratory Activity 1 – 06-09-2024**
**Focus:** Basic inputs  
**Files:**
- `GettingInputs.java` – Demonstrates how to get user inputs in Java.
- `GettingGreater.java` – Uses conditional statements to determine the greater of two numbers.
- Output files (images) showcasing the output of the programs.

---

### 📝 **Laboratory Activity 2 – 04-10-2024**
**Focus:** Arrays and loops  
**Files:**
- `GetArrayMean.java` – Computes the mean of an array.
- `MultiplicationTable.java` – Generates a multiplication table based on user input.
- Output files (images) showing the results of these programs.

### 📝 **Laboratory Activity 3 – 22-11-2024**
**Focus:** Inheritance and polymorphism  
**Files:**
- **Artists Subfolder:**
  - `Artist.java` – A base class for artists.
  - `Singer.java`, `Dancer.java`, `Painter.java`, `Writer.java` – Derived classes that represent different types of artists.
  - `ArtistDemo.java` – A driver code demonstrating the use of the artist hierarchy.
- **Output Screenshots:** Images showing the output of each derived class when instantiated and their behavior.

### 📝 **Laboratory Activity 4 – 29-11-2024**
**Focus:** Abstraction  
**Files:**
- **Shapes Subfolder:**
  - `Shape.java` – An interface that all shapes implement.
  - `Rectangle.java`, `Square.java`, `Triangle.java` – Shape classes that implement the `Shape` interface.
  - `ShapeCollection.java` – Manages a collection of shapes and calculates their properties.
  - `Main.java` – Main class to run the program.
- **Lab4-output:** Image files of the output of the shape properties.

## 💻 **Exercise Sets**

### 📝 **Exercise Set 1**
**Focus:** Basic programming tasks  
**Files:**
- `Welcome.java` – Prints a welcome message.
- `Escseq.java` – Demonstrates escape sequences in Java.
- `Tempconvert.java` – Converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## 🔨 **Objectives and Learning Goals**

These laboratory activities and exercise sets will help you:
- Understand key Java concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, and arrays.
- Implement OOP principles such as: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Work with Java collections and perform operations on groups of objects.
- Build practical applications using these concepts, from simple programs to more advanced object-oriented designs.

---

## 📌 **Additional Information**
- All Java files are designed to demonstrate various OOP concepts and enhance your coding skills.
- Output screenshots and examples are included for visual references of each program's execution.

## ✨ **Java OOP Concepts**
Learn, implement, and build powerful Java applications with Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as:
- **Inheritance:** Creating classes that inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Using objects of different classes interchangeably through inheritance.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulating data to hide implementation details and only expose necessary functionalities.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding the complex implementation details and only showing the essential features.
